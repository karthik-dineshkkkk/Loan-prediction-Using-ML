# Loan-prediction-Using-ML


• Developed a machine learning project focused on predicting loan approval likelihood based on various individual characteristics.

• Trained the model on a diverse dataset containing information about people with different statuses and their loan repayment tendencies.

• The model effectively learned patterns within the data to make accurate loan approval predictions.

• Created a user-friendly web application using Flask to showcase the loan approval process powered by the trained machine learning model.

• The web app provides insights into whether a person is more likely to receive a loan, based on the input provided.
